# IP3_Project_anthropocene

In a team of 6 we created a team based online game where the main objective was to 
plant an arbitrary amount of flowers on any surface by shooting them with a variety 
of different guns. This game was created with the use of Unity3d, Visual Studio, 3Ds 
Max, Photoshop, ZBrush.
